What is git?= Git is a distributed version control system which allows the programmers to work collaboratively and track the changes in the code base.
            = Main goals are speed, distributed work, co-ordinating non-linear workflows and data integrity.
            = Characteristics include branching, merging, comparing past versions for optimized performance.
            = Git assigns unique ID to each and every commit for the identification by hash or SHA(secure hashing algorithm).
            = After commiting the changes in the feature branches you can create a pull request from where other developers can acknowledge and review the changes.
            = Pull requests can be created from two ways, 1) from feature branch 2) from forked branch.
            = Comparision between feature branch and master branch lets us know about the additions and deletions made to code base.
            = Git bash is the windows application which acts as a command line interface.
            = [untracked to staged](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)
            = Local repos reside in local system and remote repos reside in servers and is being accessable by everyone.
