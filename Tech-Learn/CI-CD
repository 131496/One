WHAT?
Continuous integration: Frequent merging of several small changes into a main branch.
Continuous delivery: When teams produce software in short cycles with high speed and frequency so that reliable software can be released at any time, and with a simple and repeatable deployment process when 
                     deciding to deploy.

WHY?
CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications. CI/CD services compile the incremental code changes 
made by developers, then link and package them into software deliverables. Automated tests verify the software functionality, and automated deployment services deliver them to end users. 
The aim is to increase early defect discovery, increase productivity, and provide faster release cycles. The process contrasts with traditional methods where a collection of software updates were integrated 
into one large batch before deploying the newer version. Modern-day DevOps practices involve:
continuous development,
continuous testing,
continuous integration,
continuous deployment, and
continuous monitoring
of software applications throughout its development life cycle. The CI/CD practice, or CI/CD pipeline, forms the backbone of modern day DevOps operations.

HOW?
As a software engineer, you can greatly benefit from implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices in your development workflow.
CI/CD is a set of principles and practices aimed at automating and streamlining the process of building, testing, and deploying software. Here's how you can leverage CI/CD for your benefits:

Automation and Efficiency:
CI/CD helps automate repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code. It reduces manual effort, saves time, and improves efficiency by enabling you to focus on writing code rather than 
performing manual tasks.

Faster Feedback Loop:
With CI/CD, your code changes are frequently integrated, built, and tested automatically. This provides rapid feedback on the quality and stability of your changes, allowing you to catch and fix issues 
early in the development process.

Early Bug Detection: 
By running automated tests as part of the CI process, you can identify bugs and issues quickly, before they propagate into the production environment. 
This reduces the likelihood of introducing regressions and improves the overall stability of your software.

Consistent Build Process: 
CI/CD ensures that your software is built consistently across different environments and platforms. 
It helps eliminate the "works on my machine" problem by running builds and tests in a controlled, reproducible environment.

Streamlined Deployment:
With CD, you can automate the deployment process, making it faster, reliable, and repeatable. This reduces the risk of human error and ensures that your software is deployed consistently and accurately.

Feature Branches and Collaboration:
CI/CD enables the use of feature branches, allowing developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation. Multiple developers can collaborate on different branches simultaneously, 
and CI ensures that changes are integrated smoothly when merged.

Continuous Improvement: 
CI/CD promotes a culture of continuous improvement by encouraging frequent code integration and deployment. 
It enables you to gather feedback from users and stakeholders quickly, iterate on your software, and release updates more frequently.

To implement CI/CD effectively, you'll need to use tools like version control systems (e.g., Git), build automation tools (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI),and configuration management tools(e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) 
Additionally, you should invest time in writing automated tests, creating a robust deployment pipeline, and monitoring the health of your software in production.
By embracing CI/CD practices, you can enhance your development process, deliver higher-quality software faster, and improve collaboration with your team.
