Your concentration during the month of april is peak. Thats becuase you are stable with your thoughts and someone is constantly pressurizing to work and you have no 
    option but work. Also you have understood the importance of knowledge as , only it bring you value in front of the people. Goolging everything and asking people can 
    only fetch you far in the industry or anything for that matter. I have seen khilesh googling every time and so does he carry that kind of knowledge.I have seen Sachin
    who is dumb because his communication skills are not that great , because people judge you on how you communicate and status , appearance matters too. 
    Not using earphones have increased my efficiency like anything.
