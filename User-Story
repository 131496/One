Sprint[1.3]----->

{{ [WRI->RPS] Rename Service and related resources to Relationship Propagation Service from WRI  }} 
+ Changes in the repo
  = Renamed from wri to rps both in folders and code completely.
  = Learnt that renaming of the folders can be made from the azure repo itself.
  = I completed the pipeline changes and ran the pipeline , now changes are deployed and rps is reflecting in azure,today I will connect with parthesh for integration test
    and we will be done with rps 
  = I was not able to work much on optimization perfermance story due the issue that we were facing for running the pipeline on thursday and friday, I will be able to work
    on it now
  = In the rps changes, I made a spelling correction due to which, the whole rps is not running right now, so dont change anything while making the code changes.
  
                                conclusion: I delivered the task efficiently but deleted two services in azure without checking and understanding what devops people said.
                                
 Sprint[1.4]----->
 
 {{ [Sauth] caching and regenerating token [Spike] Performance related changes using avro and other connectors }}
  = I have to work on avro coder, but I am not understanding it
  = I have done a demo project for processing 5 records for serialization and deserialization yesterday, today I will be working on scaling it for 50k records and see how much 
    time it is taking to go through process.
  = Yesterday  I used 50K records for the implementation of avro coder with time constraint to it....but there is a exception caused by avro itself. I will discuss this with
    ashish today and try to complete it also try to implement connectors and connected with sachin for understanding pardos  we will continue that series today as well
  =Sauth implementation is done, few test cases are failing , i will connect with Mahesh and complete and it. if that is done, i will work on handling 429
  =Finally I gave up on both the user story as I did not put required efforts. Even though spike story was out of my capacity. Yet you were supposed to put your 100%, which was not the case.
  =Learnt how to set up code properly at this sprint. 
  How to set up:
     =make sure you have added the environment variables , It can be Run files or just environment variables.
     =make sure the version of the language is set properly eg: java 17/8 
     =make sure you invalidate caches and restart intellij
 
 Sprint[2.1]----->from june 5 - june 23
 
 {{ [[Fixing white source]] for all the three services [(updating the regex pattern)] for all the three services [Correctness probe] [Playbook Creation] }}
  = What a bad start, wasted the first day also did a mistake by pushing the changes which is not mine even after knowing that will come into the PR which made me create new branch.
    During 2nd day just redid the whole work on enrichment configuration all over again by creating new feautre branches but SUCCESSFULLY completed. What I learnt was run the application after maven 
    clean install before pushing the code into remote branch. Also do the manual testing. THIS IS MANDATORY. Then only you can proceed with PR.
  = Yesterday the build for enrichment configuration was failing, so solved the issues again to clear all the white source issues and have raised the PR for the same. Also I have captured both sonar and
    whitesource report under the task. Today I am be working on fixing wke-scheduler.
  = Yesterday I was working on fixing white source issues for wke scheduler, there is one issue  which Shantanu should mark as ignored and will run IT today, and with akshay's help we were able to run IT for
    enrichment configuration. I again did the same mistake by not marked skiptest as true before raising the PR
  = Yesterday I was marjorly working on wke-scheduler and IT is failing for one scenario, I will discuss with Akshay today regarding that and raise the PR. also I will work on the bug regarding
    regex update for the Kind which was not able to create match and merge rule.
    RUNNING IT:
    Add the testing module in the POM and project structure and clean install
    Edit the configurations for Junit settings and add the testing evn variables. PLEASE check if the env variables are added correctly.
    Add the token in the util file. and check for scenarios in runner file under feature.
    then run it.
  = On friday , I was trying into merge the PR for whitesource fix for wke-scheduler but pipeline was getting failed after ashish changes. also I was working on the bug for regex pattern and today
    continue with the same.
  = Yesterday, I was working on bug and merged the PR for enrichment configuration and wke-scheduler. Today I will make the change for merge azure and raise the PR. White source fix for RPS is on hold
    as I dont have the access to schlumberger directory in azure portal due to which I am not able to start the application in local but I have made the changes, after getting the access I will run the IT
    and raise the PR.
  = I was working on wke pipeline for regex update and have merged the PR , on the RPS side, white source issues have been cleared and build was successful, but while I merged PR , it is failing at
    whitesource stage , but when I checked the report there are no voilations. I will look into this today and pick playbook creation once this is cleared.
  = I was working on the regex update, The regex which we are using is not actually working for any kinds and I did the manual testing where wks is getting created but it is not picked up by scheduler 
    and wke pipeline,I have found a little modified one which is working for all sorts of kinds, but it is not matching with google regex pattern policies. I will discuss about this with Radhika today. 
  = I was looking into blockers identified on sonar and I will continue with the other issues today.
  = I learnt how to do [postman testing] where I have run the application first in debug mode by applying the breakpoints , if it starts successfully I can hit api to get the response. If you dont get the 
    response immediately just resume the application.
  = In this sprint I was the [sprint champion] with 3 votes and championship was shared by 3 people.
  = I had fixed the white source issue for two services which are wke scheduler and enrichment-configuration.
  = Go through the boards for further more details.
  = NO SKILL LEARNT.
