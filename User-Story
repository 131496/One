Sprint[1.3]----->

{{ [WRI->RPS] Rename Service and related resources to Relationship Propagation Service from WRI  }} 
+ Changes in the repo
  = Renamed from wri to rps both in folders and code completely.
  = Learnt that renaming of the folders can be made from the azure repo itself.
  = I completed the pipeline changes and ran the pipeline , now changes are deployed and rps is reflecting in azure,today I will connect with parthesh for integration test
    and we will be done with rps 
  = I was not able to work much on optimization perfermance story due the issue that we were facing for running the pipeline on thursday and friday, I will be able to work
    on it now
  = In the rps changes, I made a spelling correction due to which, the whole rps is not running right now, so dont change anything while making the code changes.
  
                                conclusion: I delivered the task efficiently but deleted two services in azure without checking and understanding what devops people said.
                                
 Sprint[1.4]----->
 
 {{ [Sauth] caching and regenerating token [Spike] Performance related changes using avro and other connectors }}
  = I have to work on avro coder, but I am not understanding it
  = I have done a demo project for processing 5 records for serialization and deserialization yesterday, today I will be working on scaling it for 50k records and see how much 
    time it is taking to go through process.
  = Yesterday  I used 50K records for the implementation of avro coder with time constraint to it....but there is a exception caused by avro itself. I will discuss this with
    ashish today and try to complete it also try to implement connectors and connected with sachin for understanding pardos  we will continue that series today as well
  =Sauth implementation is done, few test cases are failing , i will connect with Mahesh and complete and it. if that is done, i will work on handling 429
  =Finally I gave up on both the user story as I did not put required efforts. Even though spike story was out of my capacity. Yet you were supposed to put your 100%, which was not the case.
  =Learnt how to set up code properly at this sprint. 
  How to set up:
     =make sure you have added the environment variables , It can be Run files or just environment variables.
     =make sure the version of the language is set properly eg: java 17/8 
     =make sure you invalidate caches and restart intellij
 
 Sprint[2.1]----->from june 5 - june 23
 
 {{ [[Fixing white source]] for all the three services [(updating the regex pattern)] for all the three services [Correctness probe] [Playbook Creation] }}
  = What a bad start, wasted the first day also did a mistake by pushing the changes which is not mine even after knowing that will come into the PR which made me create new branch.
    During 2nd day just redid the whole work on enrichment configuration all over again by creating new feautre branches but SUCCESSFULLY completed. What I learnt was run the application after maven 
    clean install before pushing the code into remote branch. Also do the manual testing. THIS IS MANDATORY. Then only you can proceed with PR.
  = Yesterday the build for enrichment configuration was failing, so solved the issues again to clear all the white source issues and have raised the PR for the same. Also I have captured both sonar and
    whitesource report under the task. Today I am be working on fixing wke-scheduler.
  = Yesterday I was working on fixing white source issues for wke scheduler, there is one issue  which Shantanu should mark as ignored and will run IT today, and with akshay's help we were able to run IT for
    enrichment configuration. I again did the same mistake by not marked skiptest as true before raising the PR
