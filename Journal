I am poor at expressing things is what I feel, but the way I behave with utkarsh and jeevith makes me feel like I am actually expressable. But I can actually improve at 
this. Creating a right balance between everything is cruel. All my life my parents have made me concentrate on one thing due to which I have not gained the skill of managing multiple things at once. Everyone are good , don't have any prejudgement on anyone.
