I am poor at expressing things is what I feel, but the way I behave with utkarsh and jeevith makes me feel like I am actually expressable. But I can actually improve at 
this. Creating a right balance between everything is cruel. All my life my parents have made me concentrate on one thing due to which I have not gained the skill of managing multiple things at once.
Everyone are good , don't have any prejudgement on anyone.

I did not commit the changes and I lost all the updates I had mentioned, me being a responsible person , I will take care of it.
Pooja gets strange vibes from me,don't know why,because I am not fun at all.Utkarsh is a sweet heart but very career oriented and there is no way I can like someone with other language until I become good at 
hindi and english. keep on improving is a rat race , should I take a break? taking a break is not even a option. The only thing I am ready right now is to become a better version of myself in technically, become 
better at dealing with people, making time for parents, become a better figure, become a fun person, what you think about you is what other people think about you, because you are the virtue of your thoughts.
Create a future you want. Today I want to be in a place where I have peace and access to everything , I want to be alone till I change the company of change the career path.


WHAT IS THE FUTURE YOU WANT?    WRITE DOWN HOW DO YOU WANT TO ACHEIVE EACH OF THESE.  
I WANT TO BE HAPPY, THIS IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF I HAVE A GOOD CAREER , IF MY PARENTS ARE HAPPY, IF MY BODY IS GOOD, IF MY HEALTH AND FAMILY HEALTH IS GOOD, HAVE FINANCIAL FREEDOM.
I SHOULD BE READY TO GET MARRIED AT THE AGE OF 26 COMPLETION.
